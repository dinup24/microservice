= Microservice

This project shows a very simple hello world Microservice project, which has a simple HTTP server which
simply returns "Hello World!" to every request.

The build.gradle uses the Gradle shadowJar plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build the "fat jar"

    ./gradlew shadowJar

Because the application plugin is being used, you may directly run the application:

    ./gradlew run

You may also run the fat jar as a standalone runnable jar:

    java -jar build/libs/microservice-1.0.0-fat.jar

(You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine).
